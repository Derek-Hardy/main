Welcome to my project portfolio. I am Benjamin and I am a computing science student.
This project portfolio will detail the contributions I have made to various Software Engineering projects.


== PROJECT: MeetingBook

MeetingBook is a desktop scheduler application targeted at university students involved in multiple
Co-Curricular Activities and Project-Based modules. The application is a modified contact book with features to group
contacts and assign meetings to such groups. MeetingBook is written by a team of 5 students from National University
of Singapore's School of Computing. It is forked from
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[AddressBook-Level4]
written by https://se-edu.github.io/[SE-EDU].

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: enhanced the `find` command.

** What it does prior: the `find` command filters the displayed list of persons based on the keywords given.
Upon execution, the list displays persons whose name consists at least one of the keywords given.

** What it does after enhancement:
*** The user can add an additional parameter specifying whether to search for groups, meetings, or persons.
*** The user can put the keywords into 3 categories: a set of keywords where the results must match all given keywords,
a set of keywords where the results must match at least one of the given keywords,
and a set of keywords where the results must not match any of the given keywords.

** Justification: The extension of the `find` command allows the user to better manage their MeetingBook.
When there is a large amount of data in the MeetingBook,
the user will have an easier time searching for what they need.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a `sort` command that allows the user to sort the displayed list of persons by
name, phone number, email address, or home address by lexicographical order.

=== Sort and Find feature

The Sort and Find commands modifies the `ObservableList<Person>` in `Model` that the UI is bound to. This section will
detail how the sort and find commands are implemented.

==== Implementation of `find` command

===== Structure of `find` command

image::FindCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

When the user executes a `find` command, the `FindCommandParser` returns either a `FindPersonCommand`, a `FindMeetingCommand`, or a `FindGroupCommand`,
 depending on the user's input. `FindPersonCommand`, `FindMeetingCommand`, and `FindGroupCommand` extends the
 `FindCommand<Person>`, `FindCommand<Meeting>`, and `FindCommand<Group>` abstract classes respectively.
The `FindCommand<E>` abstract class extends the `Command` abstract class. +

[source, java]
----
public abstract class FindCommand<E> extends Command {

    public static final String COMMAND_WORD = "find";

    public static final String MESSAGE_USAGE = ...

    protected final Predicate<E> predicate;

    FindCommand(Predicate<E> predicate) {...}

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object other) {...}
}
----

`ModelManager` maintains 3 lists of type `FilteredList`. The lists are `filteredPersons`, `filteredMeetings`, and `filteredGroups`.
When the `find` command is executed, a predicate is passed into the respective `FilteredList`. The elements in the list that passes the predicate
 test will be displayed in the UI. +

Referring to the code snippet above, `FindCommand<E>` implements the `equals()` method and contains a predicate of type `Predicate<E>`.
 This predicate will be applied to the `filteredPersons` list if `FindPersonCommand` is executed, `filteredGroups` list if `FindGroupCommand` is executed,
 and `filteredMeetings` list if `FindMeetingCommand` is executed. Each of `FindPersonCommand`, `FindGroupCommand`, and `FindMeetingCommand`
 implements the `execute()` method required by the `Command` abstract class. +



===== Structure of Predicates

image::PredicateClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The predicates are created using the abstract class `EntityContainsKeywordsPredicate<E>`.
`PersonNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` extends `EntityContainsKeywordsPredicate<Person>`,
`GroupTitleContainsKeywordsPredicate` extends `EntityContainsKeywordsPredicate<Group>`, and
`MeetingTitleContainsKeywordsPredicate` extends `EntityContainsKeywordsPredicate<Meeting>`.

[source, java]
----
public abstract class EntityContainsKeywordsPredicate<E> implements Predicate<E> {
    private final List<String> allKeywords;
    private final List<String> someKeywords;
    private final List<String> noneKeywords;

    private final Function<E, Predicate<String>> testKeywordPredicateGetter;

    public EntityContainsKeywordsPredicate(List<String> allKeywords, List<String> someKeywords, List<String> noneKeywords, Function<E, String> entityKeywordGetter) {...}

    @Override
    public boolean test(E element) {...}

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object other) {...}
}
----

As seen in the code snippet above, `EntityContainsKeywordsPredicate` maintains 3 lists of `String`, the `allKeywords` list,
the `someKeywords` list, and the `noneKeywords` list. The lists of strings are generated by the `FindCommandParser` that
parses the `find` command entered. `testKeywordPredicateGetter` is used to generate the predicate that will be used to test
whether each keyword matches the element being tested. +

Each of `PersonNameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `GroupTitleContainsKeywordsPredicate`, and `MeetingTitleContainsKeywordsPredicate`
 contains a predefined function used to retrieve the `Person` name, `Group` title, or `Meeting` title.
 This predefined function will be used passed into the constructor of `EntityContainsKeywordsPredicate` to generate
 `testKeywordPredicateGetter`. +

When the predicate is passed into the `FilteredList` in `ModelManager`, the `test()` method in this predicate will be used
to test the elements in the list.

==== How the `sort` command works with the `find` command

In the current implementation, the `sort` command only applies on the list of persons.

`ModelManager` maintains a `sortedPersons` list of type `SortedList<Person>` and a `filteredPersons` list of type
`FilteredList<Person>`. +

image::sortedList-filteredList-persons.png[width="400"]

Illustrated in the figure above, `sortedPersons` list wraps the `filteredPersons` list and
`filteredPersons` list wraps the `persons` list of type `ObservableList<Person>` maintained by `versionedMeetingBook`.
`persons` list in `versionedMeetingBook` contains all the persons stored in the MeetingBook.

The list displayed in the UI is bound to the `sortedPersons` list. Hence, the `persons` list has two layers of
modification before being displayed in the GUI as `sortedPersons`. +

Before the user executes any `find` or `sort` commands, no `Comparator<Person>` and no `Predicate<Person>` is applied to
the `persons` list. The UI will display the all the persons in the MeetingBook as expected. +

When the user executes a `find` command, an appropriate `Predicate<Person>` will be created based on the user's input,
and the `Predicate<Person>` will be applied to the `persons` list. This modification will be reflected in the
`sortedPersons` list and in the displayed list in the GUI. +

Similarly, when a user executes a `sort` command, an appropriate `Comparator<Person>` will be applied to the
`filteredPersons` list. This modification will be reflected in the displayed list in the UI.

==== Design considerations

Due to this two-layered structure. The user can chain `find` and `sort` commands back-to-back to display the desired
list. +

image::findThenSortExample.png[width="600"]

An example can be seen in the diagram above by executing the command `find p s/yu li` followed by `sort name`.
After applying the `sort` command, the `find` filter remains applied. The next example will demonstrate a different order. +

image::sortThenFindExample.png[width="600"]

The diagram above shows another example of back-to-back execution.
The diagram shows the execution of `sort name` followed by `find p s/yeoh li`.
As can be seen in the diagram, the sorting order remains even after executing the `find` command.
